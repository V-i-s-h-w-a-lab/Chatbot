# Chatbot
Install all the libraries mentioned
• pip install PyPDF2
• pip install python-docx
• pip install bcrypt
• pip install scikit-learn
• pip install Tkinte`.
Then run the code using "python chatbot.py" and "python chatbot2.py". I have created two chatbot's one will be showing the output in the terminal itself and chatbot2 will show in the seperate chat interface.
You can use Windows power shell to install libraries and for the interface.
